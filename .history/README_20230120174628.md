# Motivational Quotes

This is a personal project to apply my knowledge while dealing with requests for API and React.js.

## About The Project

The main purpose of this project is to provide users with a web-site built using React, where they can select a category and be presented with an image and a motivational quote relevant to that category.

To accomplish this, I developed my own API using Django Rest Framework. It was a bit challenging to get all the correct URLs and parameters set up to make the necessary requests from the website, but I was able to overcome these obstacles.

The site allows users to go through all the quotes within a selected category without repeating any quotes, until all the quotes in that category have been viewed. Users also have the option to change categories at any time.

All the quotes are stored in the user's browser, so when the user revisits the site, it will know which category and quotes were already viewed and will not repeat them until the user has viewed all quotes within that category.
Once all quotes in a category have been viewed, the site will remove all stored information from the user's browser and start again.

## Tech Stack

The front end part of the site was built with HTML | SCSS | JavaScript | React.js

The site made request to an API built with Django Rest Frame work.

**Endpoints for the API**:

-   https://motivational-api-2kzjz.ondigitalocean.app/api/categories/all/ - All quotes.

    &nbsp;

-   https://motivational-api-2kzjz.ondigitalocean.app/api/categories/<ID OF CATEGORY>/ - Return all quotes from the chosen category.
    **Example**: https://motivational-api-2kzjz.ondigitalocean.app/api/categories/1

    &nbsp;

-   https://motivational-api-2kzjz.ondigitalocean.app/api/categories/<ID OF CATEGORY>/phrases/ - Return all quotes from the chosen category with a different answer from API. The IDs of the quotes are inside the same Json answer.

**Example**: https://motivational-api-2kzjz.ondigitalocean.app/api/categories/1/phrases

&nbsp;

-   https://motivational-api-2kzjz.ondigitalocean.app/api/categories/<ID OF CATEGORY>/phrases/?filter_by_id=<ID OF QUOTE>
    **Example:** https://motivational-api-2kzjz.ondigitalocean.app/api/categories/1/phrases/?filter_by_id=7
